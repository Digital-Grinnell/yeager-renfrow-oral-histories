speaker,words
Stuart Yeager, I want to start out by reminding you quickly or just reading some things to you of some of the events that took place in 1968‚ when you first came to school here. You did come in 1967‚ well I won't get into the events of 1967 but they were probably many of the same things that were going on in &bull;68. We'll move towards a heightened strength in the tip of the civil rights movement. By 1968‚ by April‚ Martin Luther King was assassinated‚ rioting broke out in U.S. cities all over the country‚ the House passed a bill banning racial discrimination against housing. The medium Negro income was $4‚900 as compared with $8‚000 for a white family. We were in the midst of Vietnam. I want to keep in mind‚ I'm sure you have them in mind‚ I was pretty young at the time. First I'd like to ask you some guestion about your family‚ your background and then we'll move into your arrival at Grinnell and talk about some of your experiences. Can you begin by telling me a little bit about where you are from‚ your family background?
Frank Thomas, I was born in Arkansas and my family moved to Chicago‚ fortunately they took me with them‚ when I was three and a half. And I was born in 1944 which I think is going to be somewhat irrelevant to what we're talking about as far as my experience at Grinnell. I grew up in Chicago and went to high schoalthere and later worked. I got out of high school in January of 1 62. Chicago and some states still ran a split system where you could get out in mid-year. So I got out in January of 1962 and I did not go to college right away. I entered Grinnell as a matter of fact in January of 1967. So I was almost 23 when I got there. And I worked for those five years between high school and Grinnell. I was one of three surviving children to my mother. My parents separated for good in 1960. They had had a couple of separations before that and essentially from 1960 until the time that I became an independent supporting person‚ my family was on ADC‚ and that was the family income except for what we supplemented through paper routes or whatever. So I grew up in the south side of Chicago and had‚ I guess in some ways‚ I had a lot more involvement with white people during that time because of the church that I went to. I was involved with a southern integrated church and the people had been coming to that church for a number of years from other places‚ so I think it was some involvement (there was some involvement). So I was essentially a street kid‚ I did not belong to a gang and I did not believe in a gang. I was not a street person in the sense that I belonged to a gang but growing up in the streets of Chicago you have to become a street person to some extent‚ so I was a street person. I worked. (What kinds of jobs did you have?) I worked as a secretary for a while‚ and that was pretty much right after‚ right after high school because I was very interested in typing when I was young and I became a good typist and I worked as a secretary for a dentist‚ a doctor‚ and part-time for an accountant who had been one of my teachers in high school who ran a business_ on the side‚ so I typed and did things like that. After that I worked for the Treasury Dept‚ as a clerk typist for nine months I thinlc it was. At which point I also did a stint as most young black people did during those times in Chicago when most young black people worked in the Fost Office. I always went to the Post Office‚ I did that for long time engagements or for short time en:2:agcr;1<.mts. I worked for the Post Office for awhile‚ before I got my job as a clerk typist. Then in late '6J‚ in November of &bull;63 1 I found out that I had TB. I want into the Tuberculosis Sanitarium in Chicago and stayed in there from Nov. of' '63 to July of 1 6Li.-or June‚ I'm never&middot; sure about the time but I guess it's not important‚ because I had a history of asthma; they were not going to operate on me during the time of high allery season‚ and my particular form of TB was resistant to the chemical medication. So they weren't going to operate so I thought‚&middot;&bull; 111 0lray‚ I' 11 go out and them come back.“ They heard that a lot of times but I did come back.
Yeager, You were very‚ very ill? 
Thomas, No‚ I wasn't. I never felt that I had 'l'B‚ I never had any debilitating effects so they tried to keep us calmed down because we were young. And I went in there when I was nineteen‚ and we would do athletic things‚ stuff like that and people were trying to tell us you can't do things like that‚ you're all so sick‚ well what are you talking about. So‚ fortunately I had a small area of my lung that was involved‚ upper left lobe‚ and I we.nt out in July and through my church to summer camp. And went back in October of 1 64 for my operation. Spent a month in there building up and I had my operation in November of &bull;64. I was released from the hospital‚ from the Sanitarium in January‚ end cf December‚ January. And beg2‚n working for the Tuberculosis Sanitarium‚ not the same one but the one in Hinsdale. :Because of a different environment‚ it was all white. All white community‚ in Hinsdale‚ Illinois. And I lived on the grounds. They had housing that t:hey rented cheap to anybody that lived and worked there‚ and started getting interested in going to school at Grinnell. Right after high school I had gotten actrnitted into some places‚ but I had no money. That was just prior to the big push for getting black students in places. I had been an underachiever in high school. I didn't begin school until I was eight because of my asthma‚ I went through grade school until I was twelve and a ha.lf‚ then went into high school and in retrospect I think that what hannened that I sort of burned out because I had a lot of other things~going on and I was sort of tired and never had a chance to be a child. So for the first two years‚ I really essentially did not work up to my potential. The indicators were there. People who knew said you have to work up to potential‚ but beginning into my sophmore year just before my junior year I started to worl<::: up‚ decided to do something so from then on I did work up to my potential‚ becarne an '“A“ student from that point. 'rhat v1as not enough if I don't get any money. irhe most I could get was 'f:1‚000 for my student loan at the time. I wasn't getting any scholarship money. Everyone said v;re 'd like to have you be here. I got a look at Dartmouth and places liJce that but no money. As I said‚ it was just before the big push. So going back to '65 after my TB. I worked for the TB Sanitarium‚ I got interested in school again. And I had already heard about Grinnell‚ and I had already sort of inquired in high school‚ and I read through the catalogs and looking for places nearby Grinnell‚ nearby. But then I moved on to continue working as a laboratory assistant in the TB Sanitarium and went then filling out an application--applied to Arizona State. I had the notion that wanted to become a chemical engineer. And I'm glad I got into that. But Arizona State admitted me‚ and I was all set to go to Arizona State in the fall of 1 66‚ and that fell through-at the last moment they just ran out of money. That was devastating because I was all set to go‚ and I had been‚ I though I had been committed to money. I'd been orally committed tbe money. There was nothing on paper. I got a call. That was one of the devastating times of my life. I got a call out of the blue from this woman who was a personal secretary saying I'm sorry we don't have the money. Well‚ I wasn't really aware of some of the kinds of contacts and callers I could utilize to try and push that thing so I didn't do it. And I quite my job at the TB Sanitarium so I suddenly needed a job and a friend of mine‚ a minister who was familiar with a guy who was also an Episcopalian who was his friend: he was a manager‚ a retail manager or manager of the regional office of Proctor and Gamble and ran the data processing department. I went down and got a job as computer operator‚ through that connection. And it was there that I was working when Grinnell came into my life once again. That was in the fall of 1966‚ I began in September. A friend of mine that I'd gone through the last year and a half of grade school and all through high school had gone to Harvard‚ and I was corresponding with him. 
Yeager, Now did you go to a high school in the ghetto area? 
Thomas, Yes. 
Yeager, And you had some students that really came out of there and emerged to be top students? 
Thomas, Yeah‚ I guess I should explain that a little bit. You are familiar with tracking in schools--that you track certain students. Some students are perceived as bright. Some are perceived as average. Some are perceived to be less than average. We were perceived as a group. My entering group in high school; there was a group of us. It was an all black high school incidently. I guess to say it in today's terms‚ it was 99% black‚ but I think we might of had a couple of Hispanics or something like that. We were perceived as a group;there was about twenty-five of us as being the cream within that time‚ and I stayed within that track program even though I was not working up to potential..in high school. I stayed within that program the whole time‚ by the grace of God‚ by the fact that people believed‚ that they knew I had it. So we were put in what they called‚ they didn't call it track they called it accellerated program. That had its good points and its bad points. Its bad point for me was that because I had gone through grade school so rapidly and people assumed from these brightpeople that we had a lot more knowledge than we actually had about certain thing~. One of the things that they assumed we had knowledge was grammar. We didn't know nothing about English grammar for the most part. We knew a little bit‚ of course‚ we learned some things‚ in terms of the basic kind of things they say to you as a student would have gotten from your home and from school. We didn't. But at home we're not getting English grammar. 
Yeager, What type of educational background did you parents have? Did they both finish high school? 
Thomas, No‚ I was the first‚ the second in my whole family to finish high school. 
Yeager, How far did they get? 
Thomas, My mother got to 11th grade and my father got out of high school right after she dropped out. She dropped out‚ she was a hell raiser when she was young. Her sister was the first high s.chool graduate in the family in Arkansas~-that's where they were from. She had graduated from high school in Arkansas‚ she was the first one. I was the second. My brother--I had an older brother--he was two years older than I was and he had dropped out and later on he went back to finish. So in all of my family; father's side‚ mother's side‚ I was the second high school graduate. So high school was really kind of a strange thing because I was in an accellerated program and we were like just being given a whole bunch of things‚ but no basic skills in a lot of things because people made some assumptions about what we could do and what we knew. That was what exposed something bad but yet exposed a lot of different things‚ that a lot of students were not going to be exposed to but we were also not exposed to basic things. We found that out graphically in 1961‚ in the summer of 1961‚ there was a move to start merging black students in wath certain kinds of programs where more advantaged students were getting into white high schools. 
Yeager, Was this in high school? 
Thomas, Yeah‚ for the summer. So we went out--a group of us went out for the summer to this white high school to take accelerated programs in English‚ geometry‚ chemistry. There were about four areas in that time. We took English some of us‚ we got wiped‚ we '. just got wiped; totally blown away. We all survivied of course‚ but it was an experience I would not like to go through again‚ because we thought we were hot shit‚ and we though we really had it. We went out there and sat with white students for the first time as a competitive process and talking about English structure‚ we couldn't make any out. The closest we got to it was the previous English class we had in high school before that summer and the teacher was sort of going a lot of other things‚ but every now and then he'd try and make some stabs at teaching us. But that was a valuable lesson at the time for all of us and then we got out of school in January‚ the following January in &bull;62. In effect then we had this thing going‚ and my friend‚ the Harvard student‚ my friend had been a better predictor. Harvard had tapped him and said we want you to come up at Harvard. Harvard was leading the move to grab people. All of us. All of us within that twenty-five group or so--I don't know if that's the exact number‚ but I think it was about twenty-five-all of us were expected to go to college. It was presumed we would all go to college. So he got in time to go to Harvard‚ but Harvard said when they looked at him. They evaluated him. They said‚ :i 1t.'ell ~ vre want you to go to a prep school for a year‚“ This is after high school. So they sent him to lVit. Herman. So he went to Mt. Herman for a year after high school. And th2_t was a valuable experience both for him and for me because he and I were very close;-and we wrote and I v1ent out to see him. It was a vicarious ex-oerience for me‚ but it was valuable. So Harvard sent him out there~to study at Mt. Herman so he did that; and he got out of Mt. Herman and went into Harvard '62 through 1 64. And while he was at Harvard‚ and then when moving up ncv:r to 1 66; when I was suddenly working for Proctor and Gamble a.s a computer operator. I had gotten some infor:ination and aonlied to Grinnell in that time and had visited Grinnell in lYiarch o:( '66. I just had been working at the 'rB thing for a year. I had a vacation‚ and I took a ten-day bus ride to 'racoma to see my sister-in-Ia's; my brother was in the service and he's married. So I Wf.mt out to see her‚ and I had wantc'o'd to see that part of the count~~v‚ and on the way I stonped at Grinnell to vislt as scrt of a pa:~osp~;ctive &bull; And I liked the campus and I thought it W3.S a nice place. I had applied to Grinnell‚ but I had let that lapse because :l\ -1 -&bull; ‚ ‚. &bull; “''t t d ?) r1&middot; &bull;&bull; ‚.‚. ~‚ k “f I1 I T.. J .L &middot;lac:t app_‚iea 1:;o ~~rizona ::i -a&middot; e an. -. 1. ‚4ian L‚ rea.1~y .rnm‚v 1. wanted to go to that kind of rich school. I wanted to be a chemical engineer and Arizona State had a good program. Come 1 66 then‚ late fall of '66‚ I v1as still. without a school‚ and I was working. And I got a letter from my friend which said that‚ “Grinnell is looking for you‚ and to contact John‚ a friend of ours‚ the minister friend.“ So I contacted John‚ and John knew a guy by the name of Harold Hardin. I don I t know what class he was‚ but Harold in sorn.e way..‚--I never did find out--said‚ “This is where Frank is.“ and I contacted Grinnell. Dale Terry who was director of admissions at the time siad‚ “;‚Jhere have you been?'' “Ue'vc been looking for you.“ So I told him what had. happened. So we started getting my act together to come to school. And I was :going to enter in January of &bull;67. Well‚ the problem with that was I had gone to a junior college off and on and had talten four courses all together in these intervening years and had dropped three of them because they were below my level; the only one I };:ept was Germa:n. 'I'hey had a problem getting the transcript from the junior college. We also had a problem get&middot;ting my medical history. Getting the records f'rom the TB Sanitarium‚ the bureaucracy of it was your problem. Things kept moving along‚ moving along and suddenly in DeceEibcr‚ I :finally got the stuff‚ and I'd talked to Dale 'rer:cy when we'd finally got the stuff‚ and he said‚ “:;foll‚ it's going to be too late to get you in ‚January. 1:Jell‚ vvhy don't you take the spring and go to a junior col.Jeg‚e again and keep your brain sharp and enter in September of '67.“ So I sa..id‚ “Okay‚“ But what happened c~fter that w2cs my friend thad told my friend J&middot;ohn 1:'hat.~ad happened and J“ohn Giad‚ “Do you still want to go to Grinnell?“ 1 sa~ia.‚ 'HYes‚“ 
Yeager, Had he graduated f'rom Harvard by now? 
Thomas, No‚ my friend had&bull; n‚-~);t f':::'i.encl was the 2:-iJ..y who we:1t to Harvard. He still was at Harvard‚ but John wa; the minister. So I was talking to him‚ and he sic;id‚ ''Do you still want to go?“ And I said‚ n-:tes.“ So I heard nothing more from him and then rrhursday‚ J&middot;anuary 12th--I can :figure by the day because .it was the d2.y of the first superbov‚rl that I arrived at Grinnell. ir&#10003;hat happened was that Thursday John c2.lled me‚ and I was home because I had injured my :foot--gotten athlete's fungus in a broken blister which eventually ate a hole in my foot. So I was off work and John called me and said‚ “Do you still want to go to Grinnell‚ and I said. “Yes. 0 He said‚ he'd get back to me. And literally that's the way the conversation went. So I said‚ “Okay.“ Sunday morningil Januar;y 15th‚ I got a call about 9: 00 in the morning from J-ohn‚ and he said‚ “How soon can you get out to Grinnell?“ “I don't know.“ He said‚ nFind out and get back to me.'' So I called around town to the Rock Islandt used to run a train right through town‚ and they said they could get me out here‚ train left around 2:00 and could get me out here “lround 8: 00 p.m. Well‚ I didn I t };.now anything a bout Rock Island! I didn't know that eight meant twelve to them. So you get on the train and leave at 2:00 or something lite that. Be there at 8:00 and be on it. Sunday‚ I had very little money in my :pocket‚ and I had some money in the bank. My f2.c111ily 1vas trying to get a few things ready. So I called 'rhad' s younger brother with whom I had been friendsi and the whole family. So he came over and :helped and they all got me down to the train station and I was off -to G1~inn.ell‚ 
Yeager, Can I ask you a couple more questions? Can you tell me &bull;Nhat your parents' occupations were and what their politicaly affiliations were? 
Thomas, l\'Iy mother hacl done some jobs. Ify fatter had been basically a mechanic. He really loved cars. He worked on cars. l'‚1y mother had some factoi~y jobs‚ but after she went on ADC essentially she did not work. She wasn't allowed to work:. 
Yeager, Ilow many children did she have? 
Thomas, There were three children‚ three of them. Their politcal affiliation. :Jell‚ they were pretty well‚ apolitical‚ but essentially they were Democrats. That was their party selection. 
Yeager, Do you remember them voting? At the time‚ the only reason I'm interested is that at the time that you leaving high school‚ they were having difficulty registering people to vote at all or voting in the South. 
Thomas, I don't remember my father ever voting. J:‚'Iy r:1other vot‚3d. I don't ever remember my father voting. And I voted for the first time--you still had to be twenty-one in those days--I woted for the first time in 1 66‚ 
Yeager, biho did you vote for? Johnson? 
Thomas, The first vote I cast was for a state election and was for Charles Percy. I guess by philosophy I was leaning toward Democrat‚ but Fercy was saying the right things. So I was twenty-&bull; one and I could vote. 
Yeager, Who did you vote for in the presidential election? You didn't vote for Goldwater? 
Thomas, Oh no‚ no‚ I wa.s never a Republican. I voted for j-ohnson. I was never a Republican. But my first vote had been cast for an intelligent person. '.rhere were Democrats and I voted f'or them too. 1?erc.y‚ -t.he: ~;.cr1ator“ial cctnclida-te in I llir1ois‚ i.r\las &middot;t11e be&middot;tter~ of the two people. I can't remember who ran against Percy. So anyway that was my first vote. I guGss we were Democrats. 
Yeager, In that campaign if you remember‚ were there issues or questions of race being discussed in the campaign‚ and how were you affected by that? 
Thomas, Not in Chicago‚ and there were issues of race‚ and there was the black vote.~ But Chicago‚ you may have heard has a judicial system all its own. So it didn't really matter. That was clear. 'rhey just assigned certain numbers of black votes that they wanted~ and if the numbers didnwt turn out they added them anyway. So it really didn't rnrittEff‚ and I took it all very seriously‚ and I was really believin-g; in the American system and that your vote counted and I still do. I still believe in it‚ and I still don't tell p‚20:'.J1(:; after the election like right now. It is sort of unusual to say that I voted for Percy or Johnson because I really don't tell people‚ I really bought that whole bit. So it didn't really matter whether there was a ouestion of race. The auestions came up later. Like in '68 and things like that. i-\. t the tirae that I started voting that was not a significant issue in Ghicago. There was in sorne places but not in Chicago because it didn't matter. Daley ran things. He wanted this. He wanted that‚ and he got it. 
Yeager, 1:folJ‚ we kind of got into how you chose Grinnell‚ dhat were your friends' reactions to choosing Grinnell‚ Vifhat were your parents' reactions to c;hoosing Grinnell‚ and do you consider&middot; yourself actively recruited becauss you had these contacts with John. 
Thomas, Right‚ right. l'Jellf I was actually recruited because John Dreibelbis was interested in me‚ and he knew I had an interest in Grinnell. Arni he had a friendship with Harold Hardin. So Harold I-iardin thrOl:;gh ~f ohn had actually recruited me. '.rhe college itself did not‚ but I will say for the college's benefit that the college once I got back in the process was very good. fhey worked hard with me to get me to come to Grinnell‚ and they were surprised when I showed up on the morning of ~ranuary 16th. And I got here in the morning about 12:JO of January 16th. John told me to meet the Episcopal minister‚ that he was going to meet me at the railroad station‚ and he was not there. called s_nd got another ticket home. So rn;y second view of Grinnell was sort of when I came back that time as opposed‚ to that i tme I c;:UfH:‚ in filarch of '66. I woke up staring into these blue eyes. 'Jlhis litt1e girl was standing there‚ and she went off‚ and said‚ “!1'Iam2‚‚ that rnan' s awaJ.::e‚“ John had told me not to go over to the campus'till about 10:00‚ that's when they were expecting me‚ I found 01‚it. I got to the campus‚ and I walked in with my crutches‚ and I saw Dale Terry greeting me and asJring me how was doing‚ what was v‚‚rrong with my foot and that kind of' thing‚ T;hen he said‚ “Frank‚ what are you doing here?“ I 1oo1ced at him‚ and :U+‚ 000 wheels suddenly started spinning‚ and I'd suddenly figured out that John had come up vdth a plan‚ that he 1';:new that Grinnell had accepted me‚ and that I was going to enter in September. He felt that if I did--I think he thought if I didn't go in January that I migl1t lose ir1t-;er&middot;est. V~e.J_l‚ I vvas 1'1ot goir1g to lose in-terest ~ So he had sent me out to Grinnell on the theory that if I got out here they we:i:'e not going to send me home. 'iJell‚ I thin'..lt he was right‚ but it did not seem that way at the time. So they all said‚ “I thought ve hac1:. agreed‚ and we talked about it.“ 'I1hey said 9 “Okay~ I 1 11 tGll you what 1.Ne 're going to do/' He said what language are you inte:~ested in‚ and I said‚ “German and French. 11 He s2.id 9 ““.'&middot;Jhich one would you pre.fer?' I said.‚ ''Gerri.1an.“ So he gave me an appointment with Profet'3t':ior Brown in the German Department and to go see him and eat lunch and come back after lunch arid the financial aid people were meeting this mornine;‚ and I'll talk with someone about your case and see what we can do for you. I came back af'fter lunch and came in‚ an.d Dale said‚ “hJell‚ welcome to Grinnell.“ '];hat's how I got in. 
Yeager, ~ere your friends supportive of your going to Grinnell? 
Thomas, Yes. 
Yeager, Did they think it was unusual that you were going to such a rura1 school or not really? 
Thomas, No‚ no not really. Thaddas had gone to Harvard‚ a white school‚ and other people always knew I'd go to college so they were very supportive. They h.ad :no problem with me going to college. IVly mother had some apprehensions about me going out to Iowa with all the white people and going away from home. She didn't know what I was going to do when I got there. But hell‚ I was resisting the idea. I was an adult‚ and I thought it was silly for her to be that concerned about it. l1ut she was kind of concerned that I'd be out there with all those white :people‚ and what kind of effect that was going to h2_ve on me‚ and she wanted ~ne to know that I could come home if things got bad. But for the most part‚ people were very supr)ortive to this. 
Yeager, What were your goals at Grinnell? Your outlook for the future‚ and if any‚ what dreams did you nave when you came to Grinnell for the future? 
Thomas, My goal at Grinnell was to get tha‚t piece of paper‚ and I knew from the things I 'd done in that intervening five ~rears‚ I knew‚ my feeling that academics were not that important. What are you looking for? 
Yeager, I just want to make sure this tape does not run out. Okay‚ can watch it. 
Thomas, Academics‚ per se‚ were not that important as staying in and getting enough grades sufficient to stay in Grinnell. My goal was to get that piece of paper‚ apd my secondary goal was to experience fun; have my childhood‚ because I had been forced in growing up to accept a lot of responsibility for family counseling--counseling other persons in my family and doing other things that essentially took my childhood away. I had to be a responsible kid so I had never really had a chance to sort of play. And I saw Grinnell as an opportunity to do that. 
Yeager, Had you had time to date while you were in Chicago? I mean you weren't that busy. 
Thomas, No‚ I dated. I dated more after high school than I did in high school. Yes‚ I did that kind of stuff. It was just that I had to be responsible for my sister~ And it was a battle. I kept fighting getting married. Some of the people that I dated were interested in getting married--particularily‚ this one woman. My family was very‚ filled with pressure to ga;; married. Get married. And eventually we broke up because of the very issue. She wanted to get married now‚ and I said‚ “Look‚ I gotta go to school.“ Those were our continuing battles‚ and she said‚ “Well‚ do it and you can always go here.“ I said that if I got married I knew that I wouldn't go to school. That was one of the serendipitous kinds of decisions I made. So we broke up in &bull;66. 
Yeager, Is this someone you were very close to? 
Thomas, Oh yes‚ very close. We'd been together since the summer of '63. So my goals were to have fun and get the piece of paper. And just sort of experience college life‚ going back to my ideas about buying the “American Dream.“ I had thought that part of the dream was college. That was going to be a very important time of my life. Although somewhat older than the average entering student. I saw that as a time to do that kind of thing. So that's what I did. I jokingly refer to the majoring in Grinnell in folk dancing‚ table tennis‚ and women--general recreation. My actual major was history. But I thought for the future‚ I saw myself coming out and actually being a psychologist because I wanted to be a psychologist. Grinnell changed that because Grinnell at the time was what we call the “rat“ school. It was not dealing with people. It did not have the facilities. 
Yeager, What kind of a school did you call it? A'~a~“school? A 11&middot;r.at“ &middot;schoc‚l? r&middot;~:a. t. 
Thomas, Yes‚ an experimental‚ with running mice through mazes and things like that. 
Thomas, 1-was not interested in that. I was people-orientated so I was not interested in that kind of thing. So that changed me into something else. I had to become something so I changed to a history major. And from a history major I wanted to go into Law school. I woke up in the beginning of my senior year‚ end of my junior year; suddenly realized I had a decision to make; and I also had a good CUM in my major. I was not good overall‚ but I got really essentially plagued‚ and I said what am I going to do? I can't go to school in history. So I applied to Law school. 
Yeager, But you didn't have that goal in mind when you started Grinnell? 
Thomas, No‚ absolutely no because my mother wanted me to become a lawyer. She was bound and determined that her younger‚ youngest son was going to be a lawyer. And the older one was going to be a doctor. 
Yeager, Did he become a doctor? 
Thomas, No. And hell‚ I thought that all that time up until I woke up and said what am I going to do? So I went into Law school. I fullfilled her dream. I became a lawyer. But that was not my dream. 
Yeager, What was your ultimate dream? Was it to become a chemical engineer at the time? 
Thomas, No‚ I had changed it. Well‚ my ultimate dream at the time when I first began at Grinnell was to be a psychologist. During that time‚ I'm not sure what I was going to do after I realized I was not going to be a psychologist at Grinnell. I guess I didn't have any real vision. I knew I'd get out of school. I knew I'd do something. But I didn't know what I was going to do. I had no worries‚ incidently‚ because I knew that I had a lot of talent and ability‚ and I knew I was going to be something. 
Yeager, So you came into the school with some confidence in yourself? That probably had something to do with your work experience? rhat you had the years of independence. 
Thomas, I think so. I think that was definitely the basis for that. 
Yeager, I was going to ask you what were you primary concerns as a student at Grinnell. Of course‚ that's related to your goals. You wanted to play. You wanted to get your diploma. 11\Jhat were your concerns in the world‚ your concerns‚ your general concerns? What were you thinking about at the time? 
Thomas, I was thinking about the fact that the country was in a mess racially. I was very much against the war. 
Yeager, Can I interrupt? Your brotl;l.er was in the service‚ but was he in the war itself? 
Thomas, Yes‚ to some extent. Although he doesn't talk about it‚ and it's something we keep from my mom. She was always worried that he'd go to Vietnam. He did go to Vietnam‚ but he doesn't talk about it. Yes‚ I don't know what to say‚ but yes he did. So I don't know yet to this day to what extent he did what in Vietnam. 
Yeager, He didn't tell you that he'd been in Vietnam? 
Thomas, He told me he had been there‚ but he didn't want to discuss the experience‚ and he especially did not want to discuss it with my mother there. 
Yeager, Okay‚ so you were very much against the war. 
Thomas, And I was that the political process in this country was going nowhere. That it did not speak to the needs‚ that Isaw in this country‚ for quality‚ for the end of the war‚ for getting rid of the crap‚ for providing some means for&middot;people to live decent‚ productive lives. I thought the political process was not speaking for those needs. I guess for my age‚ I was also affected very much by John Kennedy in that I thought Kennedy as being as not as good as a lot of people saw him‚ but I saw him as being sort of a symbol. And I think there's a true lesson in that because he really was a symbol for a lot of people. 
Yeager, What did he symbolize to you? 
Thomas, Spirit. He symbolized an A spirit where a awakening of a different kind of American lot of people could pull together instead of a lot of poepl getting it and being supported by a lot of peoplelike myself; black people‚ people in the lower economic scale‚ wh&middot;at&middot;~ ever. And that he gave a lot of hope to a lot of people. He was a symbol. Although he‚ himself‚ I recognized the fact that John Kennedy‚ himself‚ really was not that much of a good person‚ in the sense that we sort of saw him and idolized him from afar. As a person he wasn't that way but as a symbol he was that way and of course‚ maybe that was in a way more important thing‚ as he was perceived. I thought of John F. Kennedy in that way. So that affected me. So I guess sort of important to that perception of John F. Kennedy‚ and I recognized that I was anti-Nixon. I had been antiNixon since 1952 tjust before I turned eight. I heard Nixon on the radio‚ and I said to my mother‚ and I remember very distinctively‚ “I don't like that man.“ I did not like him‚ and I still don't like Nixon. So there he was‚ running against this guy who was going to symbolize things. And then Kennedy was killed‚ and Nixon went on being wierd and other things. So Johnson had my sight because Johnson rode the grounds well for the Kennedy staff (after Kennedy's death) to institute a lot of things which on the balance were verygood. There's a lot of debate with sociologists and historians as to whether there was any good f9r society as a whole. At the time‚ I still think so because I think that may have created certain problems. But those problems may have been created more because of the fact‚ people at the top really got greedy. And a lot of people got greedy‚ piltting their fingers into the pie. But the basic concept of a freedom society in providing equal voting rights‚ all that kind of stuff were very and I still think they were. 
Yeager, There was a question of monitoring‚ You know trying to p~t sor11e -t~rpe of cont~rol clr1d &yen;.rat:ct1 over tt1ir1gs -..to rnake s1..1r~e wthe:l 1~ar1 efficiently. The ideas the:mself were accu.rate for the -~irnes‚ but r~igh~t nov1? 
Thomas, But of course‚ during this time the marches were going. T .L went on a march. I met Dr. King; I marched with Dr. King. 
Yeager, You marched with Dr. King where? 
Thomas, In Chicago. I didn't get that close to him‚ but nevertheless I marched with Dr. King.
Yeager, Iiis daughter is here now. You know all that. 
Thomas, And Dr. King still affected me. I was in the King camp‚ and it's something that's :not talked about that :cnuch anymore‚ but just before Dr. King was killed there was a big split in the black community as to whether King was on the right track. :i{ing had suddenly gone into being against the war. There was a logical extension as to who the man was and the kind of things he wa.s saying. So he had gone to being against the war:‚ and some of the people; the “bJ.ac};: n1il~ita11ts \Nere sayir1g at the -tin1e‚ 'jI-Iey j v.re a:ce stiJ_l r1er&middot;e-in this country being httrt‚ and you ~re not add::~essing our nesds and you are on the wron[:; track.'\ arid by then. we had various languages or rhetoric com.ing out of l'1Ialcom X and his staff and other people Elijah ~iuhammed and all these people.

Yeager, I 1 m going to ask you some more specific questions about King later. I wanted to ltnow. You said you did not have a problem with 5.djusting to a rural setting. Is that true? Being b!'ought up in a city as Chicago‚ as cosmopolitan. 
Thomas, The only adjustment process I had to a rural. setting was that I was already t 1Nenty-two when I got here‚ and I had been used to going out and spending until l.H 00 a.m. drinking and :playing around. \'lhen I got to Grinnell~ women we:;..~e still being locked up; 10: JO wee1rnights‚ 11:JO p.-1::1. Frida:&#10003;-night~ 12:JO p.m .. on Saturday nights. Although men were not‚ and the bars closed 1:00 a.m. during the week a.:r1d. 2:0() a.‚111. ot1 ~)att1rclE.tJr night(‚) ir.hat v‚ta‚s t}1e bigf1;est adjtistmt:~nt I had to make to a rural sstt:Lng. I was old enough and vvas self contained enough to be able to exist within this place and to recognize the diversity of the things that were being offered that I could take advantage of. So I've never had that kind of sense of aloneness that I think other black students had actually the ones on campus. One thing I had was a lot of contact with white people already. I'd worked in the work-day world within the white world‚ not in the sense of menial jobs where a lot of blacks work; work in a world of white collar area with computers and stuff: 1like~.that and a lot of people I worked with were fun. So I did not have that sense of alienation although I had a lot of quirks about it at the time I had that kind of thing but not the same feeling. I was sitting here being very much comfortable in Grinnell‚ at the college. I was not that comfortable in town‚ but there were some certain ~lements in the town. Although I think that on the balance I was more comfortable with the people in town than a lot of other black students were. I think maybe because of the work experience‚ and I was also still an Episcopalian and still active in church and I got involved with still some more people in that town that way; just understand not completely‚ but I had just started growing away from the church‚ but I was still involved with the church. 
Yeager, How&middot;many black students were attending Grinnell when you arriveq‚ approximately? 
Thomas, I would say approximately twenty. 
Yeager, Only twenty black students. 
Thomas, There might have been thirty. 
Yeager, In 1967. 
Thomas, There were not a whole lot‚ maybe even less than that. It was a small group‚ and we all got to know each other‚ we all got to know who each other was. So it was small‚ and there was no sense of banding together at the time‚ and as I said before‚ that you would hear from these people who were here at this time that the banding together came about because all these things were happening to the black students‚ within the town especially. 
Yeager, That was 1968. 
Thomas, 1967-1968. 
Yeager, So you were here when the banding began? 
Thomas, Oh‚ yeah. I was one of the students here who helped found CBS. See‚ CBS was formed the fall of &bull;67‚ in essence the group began in the early part of 1 68. So CBS was a functioning entity. I think of it such when King was killed. Fortunately‚ I think fortunately. 
Yeager, Was the reaction to King's assassination more than the town's reaction? 
Thomas, No‚ it was already there‚ and fortunately it was there when King was assassinated because I think that right before CBS existed things could have been a lot more violent or a lot more things when Kings was killed. So I think it was fortunate that we had CBS‚ but CBS had been formed as a response to what was happening in town. As in the Grinnell black student I think at the time except for the things that were happening in town we were sort of caught here as a groupp some of us that had left their backgrounds. But as a group we wer8 sort of isolated from the surrounding events of the world. There was really an isolated thing. 
Yeager, You felt isolated from the world. Did you follow things on the television or through the newspapers? 
Thomas, I followed things. 
Yeager, You did. 
Thomas, Even though‚ a lot of people followed things‚ but in a sense none of that stuff was touching us because Grinnell stayed the same. You were here‚ and stayed the same; the tovm stayed the same. It was only because people started getting beat up and things like that‚ and then we started connecting those events to things that were going on outside the college‚ ahd the need to band together for defensive purposes became a necessity and became a reality. 
Yeager, You did address my next question I think. What kind of inter-action did you have with other black students? Was it mostly social or would you say political‚ or both? Or was it different in different years? 
Thomas, It was different in different years. Somethimes it was more social‚ and it was also black students‚ or my perception of it was that you socialize with black students mainly in a smaller level.. And it still may be true. I don't know. In smaller levels than you did say as what is perceived now that all the black students are together as a unified whole. We were sort of together as a unified whole but each of us socialized within small cell-type. That's what we did--three or four people in a group socialized. And most of us had a number of white student friends‚ but we spent more time with black friends. 
Yeager, Had you had white friends before you came to Grinnell? 
Thomas, Yes. That was not a new experience for me. 
Yeager, But your closest friends were black‚ or not? 
Thomas, My closest were black. 
Yeager, Did you have any white roommates‚ Did you have black roommates? Were you in a single? 
Thomas, Yeo and no. When I came‚ I came in mid-year. I was put into a two-room suite which became the RA suite in Cowle's Hall and that was the room that was available. I had the room that had the bathroom. There were two guys sharing the other part of the room. So that's where I lived. Then I stayed in Cowles the following year in ;67 through 1 68‚ and I had then an adjoining room with a guy I had met who was a white guy. We had a single room with a connecting door‚ and we became friendly. He was a senior. 
Yeager, What was his name? 
Thomas, Phil Jones. I had met these people when I was here in 1 67 and he played table tennis and bridge. He taught me bridge. I became very friendly so we roomed next to each other and shared a lot of things. But in that sense I never had a roommate at Grinnell. 
Yeager, That was through your whole four years in the same dorm? 
Thomas, That's right. I never had a roommate. 
Yeager, That's intersting. 
Thomas, But I didn't stay in Cowles the whole time. After Cowles‚ I stayed in Cowles a year and a half. After Cowles then I moved to-let's see. From the fall of 1 68 through &bull;69‚ I stayed in the first coed dorm in Younkers that year. That was also the beginning of the student advisory system. Then I went to the German House the fall of :' 69 through the '70 's. And then I got married‚ and we lived offcampus‚ then in an apartment‚ and my wife had come in September of 1 67 so she still had to finish up. 
Yeager, You got married. 
Thomas, In '70‚ 
Yeager, Right after you went to school. How did you know this person? 
Thomas, I met her here. I got married in &bull;70. I met a student who was also class of '71‚ and we got married in August of '70‚ and spent the last year here while I had a semester to go‚ and she had a year to go. 
Yeager, What is her name? 
Thomas, Sheena Brown; Sheena. 
Yeager, She was class of '71 also. She didn't come to the conference? 
Thomas, She Is white. She's not black. 
Yeager, Oh‚ I'm sorry. She still could have come to the conference. 
Thomas, She had other things to do so she couldn't come. 
Yeager, I was going to say did you have any adjustment periods to go through with a white roommate‚ but really didn't have a white roommate‚ and you had experiences in the working world so you didn't have ... How did white students generally react to black students? 
Thomas, Diverse ways. Depending on the amount of experience. There were; I guess there was a big difference. I think white women acted differently than white men. There were a number of white women in those earlier years who also looked upon the college as a time to play‚‚everybody sort of. Those were college years. One of the things they had a chance to do was to date some black men for the first time. 
Yeager, What kind of a scale was this dating black males? 
Thomas, I think most of the black males on campus at one time or another dated a white woman. Some of us dated more than one. That caused a lot of problems of course being a black community. There was very little of black women dating white men. There were only a couple. So there was sort of a peculiarity effect among some of the white women to go and date a black man for the first time. You‚know what it was like. You know you got some questions from somebody who hasn't been around black people lik~ you know‚ mainly‚ “What's it like growing up black?“ Not the kind of serious typical questions like‚ “Can I feel your hair?“ or “Do you have tails?“ But just trying to find out what it is like. You know. I don't know‚ what can I try and find out about you to hslp me understand what's going on in the country. And there were a few‚ as there are in any kind of society of people just wanted to do it because of the status. (The Myth). This is where it's at. I don't know to what extent other people's motives existed for dating a white woman in a black community. My perception of black women on whether or not they were dating a white man. There were several reasons. The main two: They did not find white men as a whole attractive‚ and two‚ they‚ black women as a group‚ I think perceive white males as enemies much more so than black men perceive white women that way So it was difficult to get over those kinds of concepts to date somebody who was white. 
Yeager, Had you had any inter-racial dating before you came to Grinnell? 
Thomas, One. 
Yeager, One‚ so it was not new‚ but yet new to you also? 
Thomas, Right. 
Yeager, Getting back to the question‚ were you aware of the activities going on outside of Grinnell--national events of Mr. King Malcom X and others? 
Yeager, 1IJhat about son1e of the other black people in the tovmi white people too? 
Thomas, CC11e 1;eo1Jle I tenc1ed. to rissociate v1i&middot;tf1 vver&middot;e in~ter&middot;es-tE:;j ir1 those things. I tended to associate with however those white students v1f10 ha~d i:r).ter~es-t ir1 tt1ose kir1d.s of i;hir1gs -cr1at v-rer&middot;e g~&middot;c>ing; or1. I~r1d. black students as 1vell.

I still consider myself a Christian‚ but I don't go near a church anymore because I decided that institution was no good. But King did things for me because he was there living that Christian view to the best of sense that one could given the kinds of things that were going on. He was not a saint. And a lot d‚f people kept saying‚ “be a saint‚ King‚“ or “be a devil.“ And I kept thinking‚ “Hell‚ let the man be a man. He is a Christian‚ and he is telling you what to do and he's doing it.“ 
Yeager, What were your opinions of the Black Panthers? Did you know of them? I'm sure you were aware of the Black Panthers. 
Thomas, Admiration‚ to some extent because I had‚ because of the kinds of responsibility I had had earlier. I had learned to sort of be quiet about expressing certain kinds of opinions. I was a facilitator‚ a mediator rather than a confronter. So it was sort of an admiration of the Black Panthers‚ those guys were confrontive‚ man! We had a group from Des Moines come down and they sat right here in this room and they were sitting there‚ and they were just going through the thing and one time this cat said‚ “Well we're just here to tell you that stick 'em up motherfucker we came to get ours.“ Thats the kind of things I would not say‚ but it was very influencing. I thought the Panthers were a good group in the sense I thought they were necessary. The kind of people who were involved with the Panthers except on an individual basis that I would have known this person before‚ I would not insult someone else that was a Panther‚ but if someone were to become a Panther that I had known I would not put that person‚ down. That was just my kind of personality status. I don't enjoy confrontations. And the people who were sort of doing that had really confrontive personalities so I would not willingly insult that person. I thought that they were necessary and I thought they were doing good things in the sense that they provided an edge that a lot of people could not--an effective kind of counter-point to King and to Elijah Muhammed and for me the three of them; three of them as the three movements‚ the three of them provided the effective force at that time to really do things. That was a little gap in there where I perceived myself and some others being‚ that we were the ones who had to sort bridge those gaps between those three. So we were sort of bridging‚ that's the way I felt ourselves at the time‚ as sort of mediators. 
Yeager, Did you consider going down South during this period SNCC&bull;s activities were going on and some of the... 
Thomas, I'd considered it‚ but never did it. 
Yeager, There were Grinnell students involved in freedom rides and activities such as that. Wh~t were your opinions of those things?

Yeager, Can I ask‚ were you a member of any major racial organization‚ NAACP‚ National Urban League‚ SNCC? 
Thomas, Yes. I was a member of the NAACP‚ but I'm not necessarily a group member of the NAACP now. 
Yeager, You're no longer a member now? 
Thomas, I'm no longer a member. right. I decided to let it lapse at the time‚ after Grinnell. I guess I was too poor to keep ... I've been since considering becoming a member again. That was the only organization of that kind that I belonged to. 
Yeager, Can you tell me‚ were you happy at Grinnell? What did you like most about Grinnell? What did you hate most about Grinnell? 
Thomas, I was happy at Grinnell. I guess the thing I disliked most about G:rinnell was the sense that was contained within the overall campus community for a freshman to come in‚ that those people who were my peers had things that I did not have. I was sitting in an humanities class with people who had been to Greece‚ who had been to France‚ that kind of thing. I guess Grinnell gave a lot of comfort and cover to people and you can't tell somebody's a millionaire's daughter or whatever‚ That's not true cause you can do that. And it definitely became disturbing when they were talking about when they had been to Greece or something. I haven't been to Greece. That's what I disliked‚ and the second thing I disliked at Grinnell although I am kind of not so concerned about it now. I found the tendency to over-intellectualize. I don't know if they use that phrase. In the sense that people just talked things to death. They would put intellectual connotations in things that didn't deal with reality. And shit‚ I'd been used to dealing with reality when I was working. They were always playing these intellectual games. But I recognize that that is happening in a lot of places. 
Yeager, What did you love most about Grinnell? 
Thomas, Intellectual stimulation. It sounds contradictory but‚ I liked intellectual stimulation. I liked the opportunity to experience all these cultural events free‚ to meet all these kinds of people‚ and I liked most meeting some of these people who became friends throughout this time. 
Yeager, Have you kept friends since then? You have several friends at Grinnell that you have kept in contact with? 
Thomas, Yes. White and black. Lots of them. 
Yeager, One question aside and you can go back to the conference. Had you heard of A. Philip Randolph's activities or was that too early for you? I know he continued up to 1 63 but he really wasn't in the limelight that much. ~~e;:Lg;er&middot;: 1'.7 -ou~ v:eren.' t pa1~tictlJ_sJ::-il.~r irrtei---ested. ir1 t11e n1ctr1.? }Ie c1id~r1 1 t ::--tf'fsct~ “\.roD@ }1.e \vasr1 it fJnrs o~f t}1e n101')e ca~9ti&bull;v“Gti~i11&sect;z; J.E:ci.ders a.r1cl‚ he certainly had a ~ajar role in the forties.
