Elayne Chapman Kaiser, Parents' occupation and educational background: Oh‚ this is funny. Let's see. My mother is a cateress‚ two years at Iowa State. My father‚ a graduate of Iowa State‚ Bachelor's Degree in Engineering. Home town is Des Moines. Desegregated97-98% white. Religious affiliation-A.M.E. Parents' political affiliation-Democratic. 
Kaiser, Let's see‚ I chose Grinnell because I had been up there for girls' state and liked the College‚ so it was my choice. I was not actively recruited by the College. 
Kaiser, Personal occupational goals: well‚ probably to get a Bachelor in Liberal Arts. 1VIy primary concerns at Grinnell were probably more social than political. 
Kaiser, Previously lived in an urban environment-no‚ it wasn't difficult to adjust to Grinnell. I was not lonely or homesick. Proximity to Des Moines probably had a lot to do with that. 
Kaiser, Number 8: Maybe three. Andrew Billingsley‚ a couple of Africans-I don't really remember their names‚ and a girl that was there on an exchange program from Hampton second semester. We didn't organize into any kind of a group‚ because there weren't that many of us. Yes‚ I had a white roommate‚ did not have a difficult adjustment period. I did not perceive any particular college housing policy for blacks. “Were you encouraged or discouraged to or from living with other black students?“ Still‚ there wasn't that many. 
Kaiser, Number 12: Favorably. To me‚ specifically‚ I really had no problems. Most of these white students were from the east‚ therefore they did have experience with black people. “Did white students ever confront you to ask you questions about being black in a predominantly white environment?“ No. 
Kaiser, Number 14: No‚ and I-well‚ yes‚ I did think I had a separate cultural identity. Social interaction-there was dating and together at football games‚ basketball games and whatever. I was not involved in any extra-curricular activities‚ and I did not feel discouraged-I just wasn't that interested. 
Kaiser, Number 18: I did not feel isolated. 
Kaiser, Number 19: Yes‚ but I think the effectiveness was more at home than at Grinnell. Martin Luther King was not that active nor that well known. You have to remember this was 1950. Black authors-I read James Baldwin. No‚ I agreed. 
Kaiser, Number 22: No‚ because there were no Civil Rights activities at that time. There were no black organizations per seat Grinnell. 
Kaiser, Number 24: No‚ the issues were not discussed openly. Students actively involved-I don't know. There was no chapter of NAACP that I knew. No International clubs. Hmm‚ I haven't done really too much. I think the most positive experience at 
Kaiser, Grinnell was the complete feeling of belinging. Negative personal experiences were not personal-I was a hideous student. Most personal influence on my life was probably a professor‚ a professor of zoology at the time. I just really liked him. 
Kaiser, “Did I make any long lasting friendships at Grinnell?“ Yes‚ my roommate. The black girl‚ the girl that was the exchange student from Hampton and I were friendly for some time and we did correspond for quite a bit. 
Kaiser, “What reaction did the town have to the presence of black students?“ They didn't have enough to worry about them. 
Kaiser, “Did you encounter any difficulties with the town?“ Only in the taverns. And you can see by that what kind of student I was. 
Kaiser, “Did you know of any black families living in Grinnell?“ Yes‚ I think their name was Tibbs. I'd go down whenever I could when they were having time off‚ especially on Sunday afternoons‚ and have dinner with them and visit and do my hair. 
Kaiser, “Did you know tha name of any black alums at the time?“ No‚ I didn't. 
Kaiser, “Were you happy at Grinnell?“ Yes. 
Kaiser, “Elaborate on your activities once leaving Grinnell.“ Well‚ I spent three years at Drake University‚ graduated with a bachelor. Taught school for about four years‚ on a regular basis‚ and then remained active as a sub in between the children. I'm married. I have some community involvement. “Do I currently live in a predominantly black neighborhood?“ No. “Do you currently work in a predominantly black neighborhood?“ No. 
Kaiser, Number 35: “To what extent did your courses in various disciplines address the issue of race and the black experience?“I don't think they did. 
Kaiser, Number J6: “Were you involved in churches at Grinnell?“ “The church in campus‚ or were you a member of a particular church?“ No. 
Kaiser, “The impact that Grinnell had on your life.“ I was only at Grinnell a year; socially‚ it just furthered my dealings with various people; educationally‚ it seemed to be sort of a status to say that you went to Grinnell; emotionally‚ probably first time away from home for some time. I'd like to add that this probably is going to sound a little strange‚ but my grade school‚ junior high school and high school were in a predominantly white school. In fact‚ there were never more than three or four black students at any time from grade school through college-except for the time I was at Drake. Consequently‚ I don't think my attitude was hindered or helped by my experience at Grinnell. It was more or less like a continuation of high school. 
Kaiser, Okay‚ I'd like to go back and add on number J4‚ my occupation was a teacher. I now work in a counseling office in a junior high school. I am married‚ I have four children: three boys and a girl. They range from 24 to 14. Okay‚ think that's it.
