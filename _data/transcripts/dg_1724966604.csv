Leslie Taylor, 1. My mother is currently a homemaker and my father's secretary. She completed high school‚ but did not attend college. 
Leslie Taylor, My father is a Jazz Pianist‚ Author and Educator. Attended College at Virginia State‚ where he received his teaching credentials in English. He has received his Doctorate in Music from MIT. 
Leslie Taylor, b. I was born and raised in Harlem‚ in New York City‚ in housing projects which were occupied predominantly by Lower Middle Class blacks. My family and I moved up to Riverdale‚ in the Bronx‚ in 1964. We were one of a handful of black families that had recently moved into what was becoming an Upper Middle Class neighborhood. 
Leslie Taylor, c. I was one of 38 black students in an all-male private school in mid-town New York‚ which went from pre-primary school through senior high school. 
Leslie Taylor, d. Although I was born and raised Roman Catholic‚ and attended parochial school from first through eighth grades‚ I have not practiced for several years. 
Leslie Taylor, e. Both my parents are registered Democrats. 
Leslie Taylor, 2. I first heard of Grinnell through my Assistant Head Master in high school. He referred to it as the Harvard of the midwest. I had been told throughout most of my upper school career‚ that I was not living up to my academic potential‚ and after thinking about it‚ I realized that living and going to school in the heart of downtown New York was not the place for me to fulfill that potential. There were too many distractions. So I decided to look for a college environment that would afford me the time and space to study‚ and very little distractions-Grinnell was perfect-or so it seemed at the time I enrolled. My father and I visited the campus during the fall of 1968‚ and I believe that he was surprised that I liked it. Although my mother did not see the campus until my graduation day‚ I think her reaction would best describe how most of the people who knew me felt about my choice. After taking my mother on a campus tour and a tour of the town‚ she burst into tears: She couldn't understand how I could have survived four years in a place so drastically different from New York: 
Leslie Taylor, 3. I did not really speak to any recruiting officers until I visited the campus. 
Leslie Taylor, 4. My original plans for myself in my freshman year included starting in on a Psychology major and getting to know as much as I could about a farming community‚ as I had never experienced anything like that before. 
Leslie Taylor, 5. I have never been particularly interested in Politics‚ and although I did not get caught up in the turmoil on campus that resulted from the Kent State incident‚ I don't think that Politics were ever a major concern of mineo Besides academics‚ my main concern was trying to get to know a black population that was apparently trying to isolate itself from the rest of the campus community. My background was somewhat different than most of the black students on campus in 1969‚ and my personal points of reference were drastically different. I had been taught to accept people as people‚ viewing race or religion as secondary characteristics‚ if at all. It was beyond my comprehension why anyone could mistrust and actively dislike an entire group of people because of the actions of a few of them. So I was at odds with the black community at Grinnell from the start. This fact made my interaction with the rest of the campus community difficult as well. It was apparent that the black students did not trust me‚ and except for a select few‚ the white students on campus were very cautious of me. I guess they must have wondered why I wasn't trusted.
Leslie Taylor, 6. In some respects‚ it was difficult to adjust to Grinnell after New York. I was shocked at how few people in town had never seen a black person before. My first day on campus‚ I decided to walk through town and see exactly what it was I had committed myself to spend four years in. I had passed through the business part of the town and was walking along a row of houses with the ever-present corn fields across the street‚ when a young white boy of about six years old came down from his front porch and followed behind me to the end of the block. When I stopped and turned around‚ he stopped about five feet from me‚ tilted his head and asked if he could ask me a question. I said sure! “Are you a Negro?“ he asked. I told him yes‚ and he smiled‚ turning and ran back to his house yelling “Mommy‚ Mommy‚ I saw one‚ I saw one:“ That was my introduction to Grinnell and its townspeople. I smile when I think about that incident and I remember that the little trouble that I personally experienced with the townspeople that I think could be directly attributed to prejudice‚ concerned teenagers‚ not the adults or the younger children. 
Leslie Taylor, 7. I think I was lonely or homesick for the first few months because of the social situation that I found myself in-not really being a part of the black student community because they didn't understand me‚ and not being accepted by the white students on the whole‚ because the black students didn't trust me‚ so why should anyone else? I got over all of this I guess in a few months‚ as I did make some friends‚ some of whom I still see.
Leslie Taylor, 8. I believe there were 68 black students enrolled the year I entered Grinnell (Sept.‚ 1969). Barry Huff.
Leslie Taylor, 9. CBS was a fledgling organization when I entered Grinnell. It was far more of a social organization and a refuge for those black students who felt displaced in what they viewed as “enemy territory.“ When the administration turned over the Black Cultural Center to CBS‚ this house became the meeting place for the black students on caI)1pus. There were several memorable meetings held in “The House“ as it was called. Some of them dealt specifically with social pressures to which a great many black student felt they were being unjustly subjected‚ while others dealt with the need for‚ and the possible dismissal of a black Resident Advisor on campus. 
Leslie Taylor, 10. I had two white roommates‚ both during my freshman year. The first was difficult to adjust to simply because he did not want to be in Grinnell at all‚ and took out his frustrations on whomever was handy. The second was a great guy‚ and we were fairly close friends until he left Grinnell to go back to Canada in 1972. 
Leslie Taylor, 11. The only housing policy that I perceived concerning blacks was self-imposed. Mostof the blacks liYing on campus at this time were from urban areas where blacks had been predominant. These same students found themselves in a rural environment‚ miles from the kind of life they understood‚ and surrounded by people that they had come to consider enemies. Based on these feelings‚ they decided that there was safety in numbers‚ so they opted for black roommates‚ black wings of dorms‚ the Black Cultural Center‚ etc .. 
Leslie Taylor, As far as my being pressured to have a black roommate‚ or‚a white roommate‚ my experiences in this respect were probably not indicative. of the norm‚ as I have explained before‚ mine was not the typical experience of a Grinnell black student. I aid have a black roommate for a year‚ and he and I are still good friends. He is Barry Huff. 
Leslie Taylor, 12. The white students that I was close to were puzzled by a lot of the behavior of blacks on campus. Tuey had had experience with blacks prior to Grinnell‚ and they were surprised at the hostility that many of them felt the brunt of. For example‚ if I chose to eat with some of the black students on the cafeteria (most of the blacks ate in one section of the dining room‚ this was self-imposed)‚ a white student who might have been with me was not welcomed. My best friend‚ a white student named Rusty Dawson‚ was dating a black woman on campus‚ and was doubly damned by the black students-first‚ for being my firend‚ and second‚ for dating a black woman. Tue white students on campus changed their attitudes more quickly than did the blacks. By the beginning of my sophomore year‚ I uad been accepted by the white comm1llnity‚ and by a small part of the black community‚ but that was more tenuous. I became a student advisor in a dorm (Nurris) where I was one of four black students‚ and had no trouble at all relating to people who came to talk to me. It was during this time that I mBt and started my friendship with Rusty Dawson‚ and was exposed to more social events within the white community on campus‚ with no problems at all. Rusty had grown up in Su. Luuis and had had many black friends as a child‚ but even he could not relate to the self-imposed segregation of blacks on campus. 
Leslie Taylor, The black/white climate was relaxed enough for me to be elected as President of my dorm in both my junior and senior years. In both cases the forms were predominantly white‚ and my V.1.ce President was also white. I Hever had any major problems‚ just the usual-too much beer and too much noise: 
Leslie Taylor,  Many white students did confront me and ask me what it was like to be a black student on campus. I am a very outgoing person when I want to be‚ and most of campus was aware of the tension between me and CBS‚ so I uecame a source of curiousity‚ and later‚ people began to say that I was one of the few “accessible“ ulacks on campus. 
Leslie Taylor, 14. Tne rural environment of Grinnell took a little time to adjust to‚ but I didn't consider it hostile territory. It was far more of an adventure than anything else. As a matter of fact‚ I think I adapted a little too well‚ because I :t'ound that after a few years in Grinnell I nad lost the “ability‚“ or whatever you want to call it‚ to deal with life in New York City: I Knew by my senior year that I could never again live in that city. 
Leslie Taylor, 15. Tne social interactions were fleeting‚ to say the least. Not that a lot of individuals didn't try. I remember one instance soon after the Black Cultural Center had been given to the black students‚ CBS decided that “Tne House“ would be used for various community meetings (weekly) and be available for individuals to use for cooking‚ and small social events‚ as well as community parties. However‚ the first time I urought a white friend in to cook dinner with‚ “all hell !broke loose.“ 
Leslie Taylor, 16. By my sophomore year‚ I aecided that Psychology was not for me‚ but Art was‚ so I spent a great deal of my extra time in various studios‚ but I was a dancer‚ a fencer‚ involved with the theater groups‚ tutoring Psychology to first semester students‚ and later on a member of the Educational Policies Committee. 
Leslie Taylor, 17. As far as I can recall‚ I relt no pressure‚ but by the middle of my sophomore year I was strong enough inside to have defied any pressure that might have been brought to my attention. 
Leslie Taylor, 18. I am sure that everyone felt isolated‚ and a little insulated in Grinnell. It's a sleepy little town miles fr@m anything. But the world was accessible‚ if you wanted to reach it. Tne library‚ the news ...I never wanted to know there was too much going on in our own microcosm. 
Leslie Taylor, 19. The first major event that affected me was the Kent State incident. Tne campus erupted. People were outraged‚ and very frightened. I don't think I understood exactly what was going on until much later. But like so many other students‚ I got swept up in all of the turmoil. I don't really remember too much concern within the black community until the talk began about closing Grinnell. Maybe until that time‚ a lot of the blacks didn't feel the incident affected them. 
Leslie Taylor, Tue next major event that seemed to affect me was the chance to vote for President for the first time. I remember being excited‚ but I can't say if many of the other black students were or not. 
Leslie Taylor, Tuen‚ of course‚ there was the draft lottery. That affected EVERY man on campus‚ more or less. In that area‚ the laws against discrimination were upheld-no regard for race‚ creed‚ or color. I was in the last year of the 2nd deferrment‚ so I was not directly involved‚ but black and white men crowded around those TVs and cried together when their numbers came in too low. 
Leslie Taylor, 20/21. Dr. Martin Luther King was always a hero of mine‚ since before the time that I met him (I was about 10 years old)‚ but whether or not he or any black authors had an effect on my experience at Grinnell‚ I can't say for sure. 
Leslie Taylor, 22. Being a student had little‚ if anything‚ to do with how I felt and still feel about Civil Rights. I don't recall ever feeling “obligated“ to participate in Civil Rights activities‚ but on occasion I aid‚ because the event demonstrated how I felt. 
Leslie Taylor, 23. I was a member of CBS (Concerned Black Students)‚ although I am not sure if my constituents at that time would have called me a member in good standing. I didn't fit their ideas of what a black man should be. I interacted (easily) with the white students and faculty in ways that were considered almost treasonableo I always thought that that was a shame‚ because so many students and faculty members had so much to offer‚ and this knowledge was being casually rejected by so many black students. The only other organization in which I was involved was the Eaucational Policies Cummittee. Tnis was a committee of Department heads and student group representatives that met to discuss curriculum changes. Seminare and alternative forms of education which might be brought to Grinnell. My position on the committee was as representative of the black community on campus‚ not as a rep from CBS. I made this point then and now because CBS uid not represent the views of all the blacks in Grinnell‚ although they often spoke as if they did. 
Leslie Taylor, My position on the EPC was the only position for which I volunteered‚ and I sat on the committee for a year. During that year‚ CBS took little notice of the committee‚ despite my reports to them that the EPC could be of enormous help to all students. I aon't remember what exactly happened to change their point of view‚ but it was finally decided that since this was such an influential position‚ someone more in tune with the goals of CBS should fill it‚ so I was voted out. 
Leslie Taylor, 24. As far as the reactions of the campus in general to Cicil Rights activities‚ I can't speak for all of them. I can only speak for those that I .know well. Tne takeover of the library by CBS was viewed as childish‚ an opinion I shared‚ as it only served to prove how the black students were not even willing to try and work within the system. It also served to reinforce the attitudes against blacks that did not need reinforcement. Many white students felt outraged and deprived of something that they felt was theirs by right of having paid for its use. Tnat may have been their first sample to discrimination‚ and as such may have been a valuable lesson‚ but I question the validity of that kind of act when it has the potential of making a situation far worse that it already is. 
Leslie Taylor, 25. CBS was the only active civil Rights group that I Know of while I was a student. 
Leslie Taylor, 26. No. 
Leslie Taylor, 27. Other than meeting so many people from different backgrounds that shared my views on so many things‚ the most positive experience for me had little to do with Grinnell‚ the college‚ but more with Grinnell‚ the environment‚ in two ways. First‚ I was exposed to a kind of life that I had never experienced before. Farm life was something that one read about or saw on TV‚ but to see farm animals‚ fields with crops‚ fruit trees‚ etc.‚ was a tremendous experience for me. As I said before‚ this was an adventure for me. 
Leslie Taylor, Second‚ Grinnell was the place where I experienced the most powerful friendship of my life. A friend that opened up new doors for me‚ new ways of looking at people‚ at life‚ at myself. 
Leslie Taylor, Tne most negative experience at Grinnell was three years in the making. All of the mistrust‚ all of the refusal to understand how people of the same race could have different experiences of life‚ and how differenc people could express feelings in various ways‚ and all of this just about ruined the friendship that I have spoken on above. Maybe I was stronger than Rusty. Maybe I nave dealt with the disapproval of CBS and the distrust of so many others for longer than he had. Whatever it was‚ he simply couldn't take it any more‚ and so he left Grinnell at the end of the second semester of 1972. 
Leslie Taylor, 28‚ This is a hard one‚ because there are a few. Rusty was the most influential student. The Zirlkes‚ Henry Klein and John Morris were the most influential professors‚ the Zirkles helped me to perfect my “craft“ uy challenging me and never letting me “Just get by‚“ Henry K.lein pushed me to my limits and beyond‚ and showed me that I really could learn different ways of being an artist‚ John Morris gave me the knowledge of Psychology that told me that that field was not the one I should pursue‚ and also the knowledge about myself to allow me to grow into an adult who was not afraid to express himself to the world at large‚ 
Leslie Taylor, 29. I am still close with a number of students from Grinnell. Leslie Taylor‚ Pat Turner (from Cnicago is now living in Omaha)‚ a black woman that I met my freshman year. Although I haven't seen him in years‚ I still speak to Barry Huff‚ Curt Scribner‚ Jeff Reid‚ and Rusty Dawson‚ I still keep in touch with. 
Leslie Taylor, 3O. The town of Grinnell seemed to take a lot of the campus activities in their stride. There were isolated incidents‚ mainly between blacks and teenagers‚ but I only had one personal experience. I was walking downtown to the Strand Theater with a white woman with whom I shared a class. A car made a sharp turn around a corner behind us. I turned to protect my friend‚ and a fairly full beer can flew past me alarmingly close to my nose. No one was hurt‚ just a little wet. 
Leslie Taylor, 31. The Dean of Students and his wife were the only blacks that I Knew of who lived in town. Tney were very friendly and very helpful
Leslie Taylor, 32‚ No‚ I was unaware of any black alums while I was enrolled. 
Leslie Taylor, 33. Yes. I look back on my four years in Grinnell‚ and they seem to me tone happy overall. It was a new adventure. I met people from all walks of life‚ from all over the world‚ and it was a chance to grow‚ in more ways than one. 
Leslie Taylor, 34. Graduation Day I moved to San Francisco to become Assistant Construction Manager for Tishman Realty & Construction Co. I stayed with them for about three years‚ working on a 38 story office building and managing the tenant alterations of a 28 story office building both in the heart of downtown San Francisco. In 1975 I left Tishman to help start an In-House Interior Design Group for Wells Fargo Bank‚ whose Headquarters is in San Francisco. Our group grew from two to 15 people in four years‚ as we handled the design of office interiors for over 14 buildings in the Bay area‚ including the headquarters building‚ the Operations Center which houses the Master Computer‚ as well as many Corporate groups. We handled projects as simple as refining existing space to accomodate additions to the staff‚ up to and including taking raw office space and designing from the ground up. 
Leslie Taylor, In late 1980 I left Wells Fargo Bank to join Herman Miller‚ Inc. Herman Miller manufactures systems furniture for office‚ light factory‚ and hospital use. Currently‚ I am Regional Installation Manager for the Western Zone (an area from Denver west)‚ so I travel about 50% of my time‚ but I find training people to install our product very interesting and very rewarding. In conjunction with the move from Wells Fargo‚ I moved to Los Angeles‚ where I discovered that I really am a warm-weather person. I am currently soaking up the sun and remembering those long‚ cold‚ snow bound winters in Grinnell. 
Leslie Taylor, I nave not studied for any advanced degrees‚ nor have I married. I live in a predominantly Mexican/Japanese neighborhood‚ and I work in a mixed neighborhood of Venice. 
Leslie Taylor, 35. Psychology was the only course that I can recall that might have had an effect how I dealt with the racial situation in Grinnell‚ but I can't really say that there was anything sefinite. 
Leslie Taylor, 36. No‚ I stopped practicing my religion during my freshman year. 
Leslie Taylor, 37. I came of age in Grinnell‚ in several ways. By experiencing so many different people with different points of view and varying experiences‚ I believe that I grew as a person. Being isolated by the physical aspects of Grinnell and the social aspects that the campus situation imposed‚ I learned to rely on myself far more‚ and to fortify my belief in the person that I was. I also learned to develop and care for friendships more than I nad before. True‚ I allowed the pressures of misunderstanding almost to destroy a relationship that was more important to me than any before‚ I learned from that episode also. Since then I nave never allowed the opinions of others to alter what I felt was right for me‚ and at times I nave actually fought to hold on to whatever it was others had tried to take away. I saw first hand what fear can do to people. I experienced how a small group of people taught to fear another group would impose restrictions on itself that it otherwise would never have tolerated‚ simply to feel the imagined safety of numbers. I watched as these self-imposed restrictions created more distrust and distance between blacks and whites‚ and created a situation where black students could no longer see the need for interaction with the White community. I remember trying to argue the problem from their point of view. I asked CBS why they objected to interaction with the white community and asked why they didn't want to know what these students did or thougnt. If they were the enemy‚ wouldn't it be beneficial to know what they were doing and thinking? Especially if you believed that they were “out to get us“. No one seemed interested.
Leslie Taylor, Educationally‚ I realized my potential. I earned (I made Dean's list) and found that education can be a joy. But I think that for the most at Grinnell. I tnat education part‚ my greatest discovery was about now I interact with people‚ how people perceive me‚ and just how much I like to learn from them‚ and I guess how impatient I can be with them at times. 
Leslie Taylor, I am not sure that Grinnell will ever be able to attract the number of black students that it seems to want and have them have the kind of experience that they should because of the environments from which these students are taken‚ and the environment into which they are )placed in Grinnell. The black students during my four years were predominantly from urban areas where blacks were predominant. In effect‚ these students ruled these areas. To take these students‚ place them in a rural area so completely different from their previous experience‚ place them in a living situation where they are no longer dominant but drastically outnumbered‚ and almost totally isolated‚ and then expect them to be happy‚ well adjusted students‚ is not realistic‚ in my opinion. Grinnell was a terrific experience for me‚ but not one that I would recommend for every black student that I know. It was a special place‚ for special people. Maybe that's conceited‚ it isn't meant to be‚ but I don't know how else to explain it. 
Leslie Taylor, Emotionally‚ Grinnell taught me that there was another world outside of New York City. A world with people who trust‚ who smile‚ who share with one another. I learned to love while in Grinnell‚ not just friends‚ but nature‚ and learning itself‚ and more importantly‚ to love myself‚ and to appreciate what I could do with and for myself‚ and whay I could withstand. 
Leslie Taylor, I wouldn't trade one day of my experience there.
