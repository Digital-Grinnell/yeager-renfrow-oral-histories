Leslie Taylor, Hi. I'm Leslie Taylor‚ and I live at 2275 W. Boston Blvd. in Detroit‚ Michigan. Pretty soon I'll be moving into my own apartment‚ so that address won't be current by the time you get this. (Current address: 111 Cadillac Square‚ Apt. 17-F.) 
Taylor, My mother is a Ph.D. in anthropology‚ and she's a professor at Wayne State University. She teaches medical anthropology‚ cultural anthropology‚ and also some courses in gerontology‚ which is the study of old people. Myfather has a Bachelor's Degree in architecture‚ and he is an architect here in the city of Detroit. He's also a designer and an artist and a photographer. 
Taylor, As far as my home town description‚ it depends on which year you pick.I've moved around a lot‚ so let's see. The easiest way to do it is to go back as far as I can remember. 
Taylor, From the time I was two years old until I was about seven‚ I lived in Pontiac‚ Michigan in what started out as an inter-racial neighborhood‚ slowly turned into an all-black middle-class neighborhood by the time we left. I then moved to Cincinnati~ Ohio‚ where the neighborhood was all-black‚ lowerincome; very low income. After that‚ we moved to Amherst‚ Massachusettes‚ which is‚ let's see‚ our neighborhood there was primarily all-white. We were one of four black families in our particular neighborhood. Amherst is a small college town. Amherst College‚ Smith College‚ Mt. Holyoke‚ Universityof Massachusettes and Hampshire College are all right there. Everybody there was pretty much middle-income‚ middle-and upper middle-income. Small college town-you know‚ basic small college town with professors and students all living together. My high school was in Amherst-I went to high school in Amherst‚ and it was primarily all-white‚ with about 50 to 100-no‚ about 50 black students out of about 900 total students. A very small high school. A very close-knit high school also. 
Taylor, Our religious affiliation is Congregational-we belong to the PlymouthCongregational Church which is one of the United Church of Christ ehurches. My parents' political affiliation‚ as is mine‚ is Democrat‚ and I chose Grinnell because‚ well‚ my father wanted to go to Grinnell initially when he was looking into colleges‚ and he told me about the school. I wanted to be a lawyer when I first went. He told me about the school‚ and I looked into it and fell in love with it immediately. Most of the things that I liked about Grinnell are things like the personal attention you got. All the letters I received were 11 Dear Leslie‚“ not “Dear #432‚ 11 or something like that. My friends' reactions to me going to Grinnell were very-were-they all thought I was crazy. They all thought I was insane to go out to Iowa to go to college. May parents were in favor of it‚ and I liked it. No‚ I was not activelyrecruited by the college. As I said‚ my father suggested it‚ and I looked into it and I fell in love with it. And I decided to come. 
Taylor, As far as personal and occupational goals that I set for myself once I got to Grinnell; the first personal goal was to graduate‚ and after about a year and a half of indecision‚ I finally decided to settle down and get my act together and pursue a career in the media. I did not want to transfer from Grinne11-I loved Grinnell. So I decided the best way to do that was to major in English‚ and to get a lot of theater background. At that time it was too late for me to do a double major‚ so I decid2d I ~ou1d major in English and would ~s effectively 2 ~inor in theater. ~~ career goal was to become a television producer. That's after ~rnnting to be a lawyer anr:l a doctor and a reliqious studies major and about every otl1er kind of major that you can think of. I'm no‚‚.; working at a te1ev1sion sta.tion in Detroit‚ I1 m working at irnrv‚ Channel 1lan ~SC affiliate. I'll 00 into that a little later-I think you have a question later on about what I'm aoing now. ~'y primary concer:1s onc‚3 got t0 Grinnel'!‚ as far as acaftemics: I wanted
Taylor, To try and do the best that I coulr.:‚ and my acadern&middot;ics should have come first; and auHe often thev did riot. StuarL as vou !:.>robabh:-remeniber. I &middot;ttas invo1ved in about s‚:‚ 000 di ffer2nt organizations‚ anr:l I had about four or five different jobs-an at the :sam2 time. “s~‚t I finally 1earn.::d hm‚: to organizi:: my time :‚>Je11 encuJh that I could he involved in all of thos&bull;:: things and take care of my academics at the same tim::;. 0ne tr.fog tha.t I learned from hein:; in different organizations is that-well. one thing I learned at sc~ool really‚ is that you 1~arn a. lot not only out of th?. t:‚ooks‚-okay‚ your '.)rofessor may assign you to reaJ chapter three one day and chapter ten the next day‚ but you learn a lot out of h2&middot;ing involved <in a lot of different schocl activities. I learner! a 1ot bei n9 in CR$ (Concr:1rr.eJ ~1 ack Students). I 1 earned a 1ot be ins a forum desk attendants ! learned a lot bein9 all sorts of things at school. And I think part of being at school is learning not only what's in the hooks‚ ~ut learning a 1ot from your floor~ates‚ your dormmates‚ other classmatGs. people in other organizations‚ ~eop1~ in town-that type of thin:. And that's-that 
Taylor, \“las a goal I set for n\vself‚~ I guess _you could ca.11 that one of my social &micro;riinary concerns v1as to 1earr1 ho1tl to successfu11;' dea1 v1it~1 a lot of diffe:rent kin~s of people ijn1 learn from them-learn a lot from the peoole in the International Or~anization and learn a lot from the peoole in all kinds of d&middot;f fferent grouos ~ 
Taylor, Po1itica11y‚ I wanted to become 2 lot ~ore politically awar~. I was av:ful 1.21 she1 tr~red in Cri nne 11 l\nd one thing that v'!e tend to think once‚l ~~'re out there is that everythin3 is all hunky-0or0y anJ that nothing ever can ~urt you‚ nothing can ever get in your way. But once you ~alk downtown you realize t\at that's not always the case. ~nd y0u 1 r2 not always quit2 a~are of w~at the Presid~nt is dainseith?r‚ tecaus~ you ~0~ 1t have a lot of time to r~ad the newspaper. you don't have a lot of time to sit in front_of the nevJs ever:‚‚ ni qht“ So one of n\:l concerns t&middot;Ia_s‚ throuqh ens and through a lat of oth2r things. to ~ecome a lot ~ore politically 3~are and to und2rstand ‚‚1hat all 'do.S soin9 on and hO\'.t it aFfoct<?d me and other black p(:>oci1e in .~merica. 
Taylor, Yo1Jr next question about adjustin3 to Grinnell: adjusti~g to ~rinnell's rural setting was not hard because. as I said‚ I cane fro~ a s~a11 college town coming out o~ high sc~ool‚ and I just went back to a small college town. 
Taylor, The difference came in th~ attitudes of t~e people. Ona t~ing that I came across a l0t was a type of racism in Grinnell that I'1 never experiencerl !:'Jefore. P20;:ih: starhg~ people ilsking very stupid qL1estion lH(e‚ “\+hy arE‚n 1 t the pa1ms of my hands dark like the rest of me?“ or “Uhy aren't the so1es of my feet the same color as the top of r:1y feet?“ “Do I have a tail?“ 11 Do I really love fried chicken?“ You knm‚1‚ that typA of thfog. I don't ev‚~n '<now how to frv chicken! reoole starin0‚ peoole callina me names. people-first day o~f-school~ my freshman year. t!ew Student bays‚ the very first‚ day of Ne\'>' Student Days I was threatene~ to ~e r~ped and lynched if I ever came back into town again. That type of tiring. ft‚nd that happened more than once. It's not like it happened every day. but if di~ happen. And that's-that was tlie hard~st thinry to get useri to‚ ~nd I don't think I ever really got totally used to it. 
Taylor, Y2ah‚ I was lonely and homesick w~ile I was at Srinne11‚ but I thin~ that happens to everyon:? no r:iatter where ‚tou go tc schoo1. l'-ut I think my friends helped ~ea lot with that. C~S ~ecame mv ho~e. CSS hecame mv family-COS is Concerned 31acl< StudE'nts -1n case \t'len you're 'Hritins all t~ds up sm:1eb;dy doesn't kM\&bull;J what it is. That or0anization h~lped me ~ufte a tit while I ~as at school. /'.nd I came out with some very‚ very close frienf's-sorne very ::::ood friend~ out of the situation an~ out of school.

There was another professor‚ Estella Salesshe was an En;lish professor. I think the largest number of people at one time was around 45. ~y senior year‚ when I l~ft‚ we had about 30-excuse me‚ we had 28 students altogether. A lot of t~e people that I named obviosly graduateds and some of them just left on their own. So that ~umber fluctuat~~. but those are as many ?eople as I can re~emb~r. 
Taylor, I had a pretty good interact-ion \'lith rr:nst of the b1ack studetns there--;&bull;.ie had to. It 'das a matter of survival‚ a 1-:-:atter of keeping your sanity. /\nd the ~lac~ st11rlents t~ere 1 as I said‚ became your fa~ily-became my family. ~e helonged to C8S and there were a lot of time that were really goo~ ti~es there. Every Thanksgivi ng-He11 every ho1i day‚ renl1}1.. every Thanks givi WJ and every Easter‚ we would Jet together and cook a 1inner‚ cook a ~reak~ast a~d just cook for each othrtr‚ h~ together ind celebraf‚i?. to~1ether. The ni t1t before Thanksgiving w2 would all have an all-nighter-we 1 ~ a11 just be together and be &middot;11Ke a fanri1‚y. Sorrr2 of tht~ ot~-~er good_ tirnes \Vere tilG times ~&bull;Je perforrned thetE~-&middot;~tht? Youn-g‚ G&middot;ifted and Slack Gcspt::-1 Choir~ You knov:i thing that-it'‚s amazing tha.t once '/OU lt:ave‚ _you don't forget things. like-you don't forget good friends‚ you don't forget-you don't forget the special times that youshared. I was in the hospital‚ and the whole choir came up and just joined hands and stood around my bed and started singing. I got well a lot faster because of their faith in me and just them being friends‚ I think‚ helped me a lot. A lot of times we just sat up all night talking and acting crazy. It's ha~d~ to really describe the situation-it's just a feeling that you have‚ a feeling of togetherness‚ a feeling of family‚ a feeling of closeness‚ a feelingof-I don't know. I can't really describe it. It's a very special feeling that you develop when you're one of a few and those few are your support group-those few are your family‚ those few are the people that you count on and depend on and they're always there for you and you're always there for them. It's the kind of special relationship. 
Taylor, I had one white roommate-actually I had two‚ only one of them left‚ she lived in town with her boyfriend‚ so that doesn't really count. But she and I got along very well. My second white roommate and I did not get along at all. It was not because she was white‚ it was just because of personality conflicts. For example‚ she would go to bed at 8:30 at night and get up at five o'clock in the morning and not expect me-expect me‚ rather‚ to not come in the room after 8:30 at night to study‚ and things like that. There were a lot of things that just were not compatible between us. She was a very earlymorning person‚ and I did my best studying in the evening-at night. And so there were a lot of things that just did not click for us. After I moved out‚ we had a lot better-we had a much better relationship. 
Taylor, We did have housing for black students‚ only it wasn't exclusive housing. It was called the “cluster system‚“ where you would live on a floor with other black students in an all-white dorm and the rest of the floor would be white. It's just like a group draw‚ okay‚ where you just elect to live with a bunch of your friends on the same floor. And I was involved in that all-my freshman year I was‚ my sophomore year I was‚ my junior year I wasn't‚ and my senior year I was in a way. We had‚ three-three black students living on the same floor that just decided to live on the same floor. It wasn't an officail “cluster‚ 11 but I guess I can say that I did do that. And nobody was pressuredinto living there‚ and nobody ever pressure me to live with a black student or a white students‚ nobody. It just wasn't a concern. It was a personalchoice‚ and it was something that we thought would be good to help a lot of the black students coming from cities and coming from predominantly black environments to help them adjust to Grinnell. It's kind of-it is very difficult to come from an all-black environment‚ all of a sudden to be thrown into the middle of Iowa-an all-white environment with townspeople who are not particularilyhappy about you being there anyway; to a relatively difficult academic environment. And the black students on that floor‚ as does CBS‚ provide a support group‚somebody for you to talk to‚ to be with‚ and to help you get used to beingaround‚ or being at Grinnell‚ I guess I should say. By no means did the cluster system ostracize white students. By no means did it encourage black students to stay awar from white students. Quite the contrary. It encouraged camaraderie. It encouraged people learning about other people. It encouraged folks to just get together and get to know each other. That was part of what the cluster was for. And this idiotic‚ idea that the black students were trying to separate themselves from th~ white community is absolutely insane. If we wanted to do that‚ none of us would have ever come to Grinnell. That makes no sense. 
Taylor, ':ost of thf: v:hit:> students at Grinnell 1;1en:i-I mean-.vJere great. ~1obody-most of the time color never entered into a 1fri~ndship. Most of tile time. A 1ot of white students that I remember my freshman year and sophomore year had never seen blac~ folks before 1 had ~ever be~n around black fol~~ before. And they had some pretty bizarre questions. It was kind of hard to try and educate ourselves and educate them at the same time. But we managed. One thing that it1 s important to realize 'is that for (~very &middot;‚>1hite student that had never SE:en someboc!y ~;1ack and came up ancl as keel a question‚ there must have been some rn-::ire that had 
Taylor, absolutely no idt~a &bull;‚1hat to ask-v!ere afraid to ask. And t“:at's sad‚ I bad a. very good relationship ~ith most of the white students in school. There were 
Taylor, a few that r could not get along 1‚dth and c'.Ju1dn't get alon&middot;J vdth rne. But that happens everywhere‚ That's not necessarily a racial think‚ it's a ;Jers:}na&bull;
Taylor, 1ity‚ thin~;~ 
Taylor, You asked‚ “Did \01'.&middot;>iti~ students river confrontyou to discuss and nsk questions a:iout being '-:lack -Jr1 a !')redominantly writ':! environrnent.?'1 Yes. 11.nd ‚&bull;!E talked a!)out it quite a bit. Several students 'i'/Ou1d ask me‚ 1&bull;~‚/h~1 d&middot;Id I come to Grinnf:11?“ t'Wasn 1 t it di ff“i cult to be in ar al1-iJr‚ite environment?“ And it 1:1as‚ at tir;1es. Sut most of the time it was okay‚ most of the time it was fine. 
Taylor, You ask‚ “Did Gr&middot;irH1t:'ll 1s predor1inantl~J' v:thite 2nvironrnent cz1us~ problems '.!!ith ‚)lour O\.\'n cultural ide~t~it_y&bull;?u P{o ..

Taylor, ethnic backgro11n~s all hav2 a different cultural identity. Instead of ta~inJ that a~ay from so~eane‚ you would hop~fully add to it and learn from i~. Yeah‚ I did think I !1ad a separate cultual identity‚ but I shared that‚ and I hope people learned fro~ it. That's part of what SPS's Cultural Vee~end was all aboirt. ''e woulci s~are part of our share part of the things that we did ordinarily 
Taylor, '#ith ever_yone else‚J and tr~‚ to shov1 the cornrnonalities and also try tc s.hov.‚' t!1e diffr~renccs and tr‚y to shov‚1 the beaut~/ of th::: differences s anC I thin!< that v‚1as ir:1pcrtant. 
Taylor, You ask~ “ttrat kil'ld of social interaction took ;>lace !'Jst\&middot;N:en the black students and the \:1rdte students?“ :‚~ost of it vJas very good as far-you know‚ r can only speak for myself. ~utmost of it ~as very 300d. I spend time with other white students‚ obviously. Went out‚ went to ~ars. went to the movies‚ went to dinner‚ you knew. They were my friends. I developed friendsbips. and I think a lot of the other black students developed friendships also. I know they did. 
Taylor, 1-lere's a list for you: “1‚Jhat kind of extra-‚curricular act&middot;1vities ':!E:r1: you involved in at Grinnell?“ Let's see. I was on-let me start with freshman year. I was on-I was in CRS‚ I was on the volleyball team‚ I worked security ?atrol‚ and‚ what else did I do? That was probably about it. r1y sophomore year there was CSS‚ I was i1 model for Images‚ I ;'/as a ;‚mitr2ss at ‚J.D.'s‚ I <:mrked as a tour 9uid‚~-my freshma:-i year I did some tour guiding also. I v:orked a::; a tour guide‚ ?ihat Ei1se? I v‚as on Judicial Council. My junior year I was also on Judicial Cou~cil and CSS and I ~as a tour guide and worked the Forum desk and continued ~odel ng and rli~ some tut~ring-a littlP bit. i1hat els~ did I do? It ~ee~s like did an awful lot. Oh‚ I ~as in the choir Young‚ Gifted and Slack Gospel Choir. Just constantly running from one ~eeting to another‚ so it had to be more than that. My senior year I was in the choir‚ I was on CBS‚ I worked the Forum des~‚ I worked as a model‚ I worked as a tour guide. I worked-I did odd jobs-I babysat and stuff like that. I was involved in-oh‚ I want to the United Church of Christ conference meetings with President Drake and Chaplain Haas and some other folks. Went to the National Conference and to the Regional Conference for the United Church's Homeland Ministries Council on High Education. I'm also involved in that here at home‚ now that I belong to the UCC-United Church of Christ. 
Taylor, What else did I do? Oh‚ I was a D.J. for four years. I was-I produced a television show. I was the advertising manager for the yearbook. I was a co-chairperson for the Telethon-worked the Telethon ever since it started. I'm now the class fund director forthe class of '81. What else? BLACC‚ Blacks Living a Commitment to Christ‚is another organization that I belonged to. I did about 50‚000 things-I don't remember everything. But I was involved in a lot of things. Always. Always busy. I don't know how I would have lived if I wasn't busy‚ half the time. 
Taylor, Okay. Question 17: “Did you feel discouraged from participating in any extra-curricular activities on account of your race? Were any school activities restricted from black students?: That's a strange question‚ well‚ it's a difficult one to answer‚ I guess. The only thing I felt discouraged from doing was the folk dancing. Everything else was open to everyone. And it's always open to everyone. I think I felt peer pressure as far as not getting involved in folk dancing. Oh‚ I played “Kiss. of Death“ for a little while. What else? But no‚ I don't think I felt excluded from anything. I think the only thing that prevented me was my schedule from being involved in more things. Let's see ... 
Taylor, “Many alums have suggested that Grinnell is insulated or isolated ...11 Yes. Grinnell ~oes isolate students from the real world. And did I feel isolated and insulated while I was at school? Any college environment does that anyway. But at Grinnell. it's-I think it's done even more so. You're in the middle-you're out in the middle of nowhere‚ and you're led to believe that everything's fine‚ everything's nice and comfortable and the world's just kind of going on about its merry way‚ and you don't have to deal with it until you graduate. Then you begin to learn a lot about what actually goes on‚ and all of the budget cuts that go on and all of the unemploymentthat is actually out in the world. You're too busy to get involved‚ at Grinnell‚ in the real world. So‚ yeah‚ you are isolated and insulated. I was very unaware of national events taking place.w~ile I was at Grinnell. That's part of being isolated and insulated. You're sheltered. You don't realize what's going on until it's right there. 
Taylor, There weren't many civil rights activities going on while I was there. Right now there's the Voting Rights Act or the problems with it being reinstated‚ and I'm wondering how many Grinnell students are aware of the problems thatwe-&bull;might face if the Voting Rights Act is not reinstated. I wonder how many people actoally know that it's coming up again. 
Taylor, Let's see ...okay‚ when Martin Luther King was active‚ I was a little girl.So I wasn't really aware of what was going on. I remember when he died‚ and I remember how terrified I was. I don't really remember why I was so terrified. 
Taylor, I think I just felt the terror that everyone else felt-it just kind of rubbed off. I remember people explaining to me what that really meant. So that-youknow‚ I was young at that time‚ so I believe the other alumni would be able to answer that a lot better. 
Taylor, Black authors that I read at school-yes‚ I read quite a few. I read Blasingame‚ John Blasingame‚ John Hope Franklin‚ James Welden Johnson‚ W.E.B. DuBois‚ Booker T. Washington‚ Anne Moody‚ Sarah Wright‚ Frederick Douglass‚Richard Wright‚ a lot of playwrights‚ different playwrights‚ Nikki Giovanni‚ Sonia Sanchez‚ James Baldwin‚ Maya Angelou‚ Stokely Carmichael‚ Langston Hughes-a lot of different people. Lots and lots of different people. And they did affect the way I thought abou things and affected they way I deal with people and dealt with myself as a black woman. Tony Cade Bambara‚ Alice Walker were some of phe people that we read‚ that I read‚ while I was at school. They way they affected me‚ I guess‚ is that I took a lot more pride in myself and a lot more pride in what people had done before me and I felt a responsibility not to let them down and so that made me react in ways that I probably would not have if I had not been aware of what had actually taken place before I came along. We didn't really have any civil rights activities going on on campus except for the type of things that CBS would deal with‚ and those weren't really civil rights things. Also‚ when I was at home‚ there weren't very many. I am a member of NAACP‚ if that has anything to-if that can help you out with your question. 
Taylor, I'ave already gone through the organizations that I've been in‚ and you can tell just from being there now‚ Stuart‚ which ones are black (CBS‚ Young‚ Gifted‚ and Black Gospel Choir and BLACC) and which ones are biracial. As far as black-white issues being discussed openly‚ we had a forum‚ and open forum that took place in North Lounge in April of '81 where a lot of-a lot of tension had been building up this past year about white students thinking that black students were separating themselves. A lot of tensions and concerns about black students or CBS becoming a separatist organization‚ or that typeof thing. So‚ in April we decided that it was time to raise those questions and get them answered. So we had an open forum. And a lot of the fears‚ a lot of the concerns‚ a lot of just questions that white students had were brought out and were answered and were discussed and were dealt with‚ I hope‚ effectively. There were‚ a lot of things that we had no idea people were feeling‚ and it kind of made clear the reasons for a lot of the problems‚ or the rationale behind a lot of the problems‚ I guess you could say. And yeah‚ we had a really good turnout and people were actively involved and people raised questions‚ and I hope that that kind of thing is continuing. I have no idea whether it is or not‚ but I hope it is. 
Taylor, There was no Grinnell chapter of the NA8G~‚ but-at least when I was there there was no chapter of the NAACP-but‚ as I said‚ I'm a member here in Detroit. I was not involved in any of the international clubs‚ but I had many friends who were from different countries‚ so I guess that helps a little bit. 
Taylor, “The most positive and negative experience‚ I think‚ was the first day at school when they four guys surrounded me in fron of Coast to Coast and threatened to lynch and rape me if I ever came into town by myself again. My most positiveexperience was getting over a very‚very difficult academic period. Coming out of it off of probation‚ coming out of it a lot stronger-taking twenty credits one semester‚ taking twenty-one credits the next semester‚ and graduating in May. That was my most positive experience. It strengthened me a lot. It made me realize that I don't need to depend on the approval of other people‚ I don't need to depend on all of my friends to make it-that it's most important that I depend on myself and that I have inner strength. And I had the brains to do it‚ and I graduated in May. That's something that I thought would not happen. I think that a lot of the things that I learned out of that-that would be the most positive experience. So the first day of school and the last day were the two most positive and negative. 
Taylor, It's funny. The person who had the most personal influence on my life isn't a student at Grinnell. I think when Andrew Young came to Grinnell in January of '81‚ he had a very large impact on my life. We talked at length about several things. One of the things that he told me was that once I got back to Detroit to go to Nicholas Hood's church ... the Plymouth CongregationalChurch. Just visit the church and see how I liked it and tbat type&bull;of thing.Well‚ I did go. And Nicholas Hood was very influential in Andrew Young's life‚ as I came to find out from talking to both men. After attending Reverend Hood's Church for a while‚ I also realized that he was a citycouncilman. I got a job working with him as his press secretary and research intern. Later on‚ that developed into a job at WDIV-TV here in Detroit‚ Channel 4-it's an NBC affiliate. And one-thing that Andrew Young told me was that when I begin my-when I begin down the road to big time T.V. to remember my campus beginnings with a poor Georgia preacher. Hell‚ I wrote that poorGeorgia preacher as he became mayor of Atlanta and told him what had happenedand that I'm now working at a television station and starting well on my way to what I really want to do. So he had a tremendous impact on my life. As lot of the things that he told me he had done when he was my age during the civil rights movement and when he was at college and that type of thing had an impact on me. 
Taylor, Another person who had an impact on me was April Brown. She was the Minority Recruitment Officer my freshman and sophomore years at Grinnell. April had a lot of strength‚ a lot of savvy‚ and I kind of fed off of that and learned a lot from her. A lot of the things that she told me about just plainsurvival helped me a lot‚ and I learned from that. 
Taylor, I'm not sure who else really had a strong personal impact on my life as a student‚ but I know there were a lot of preofessors there that really cared. Barry Huff. Barry Huff had a tremendous impact on my life. If it wasn't for Barry‚ I probably wouldn't have made it a lot of the time. Anyway‚ Barry was there when I thought I should give up‚ and Barry was there when I made it‚ and Barry was there when I graduated. I think‚ well‚ sometimes you can classifyBarry as a professor‚ so I guess Barry would be the professor. 
Taylor, I did make a lot of long lasting friendships at Grinnell. Out of white students‚ Karen Kintner is probably the closest friend that I will ever have from Grinnell. She and I are just like sisters‚ and we're fantastic friends. She's one of the dearest people to me‚ one of the most important people to me. As f&r as black students‚ Tony Whitaker will probably be my best friend out of Grinnell. Tony and I were very close for about-well‚ pretty much for the entire four years and still are very close friends and will always be. 
Taylor, As far as reactions that the town of Srinrell had to the presence of black stt!dzc;n'!:s‚ r think I' vc‚ ;rnswer'?d that in 'l couol e o~ di fferer:t segrnents. Sut one thing-they didn't like it a whole lot. You could wal~ down t~e strEet‚ an1 people ~ou1d stop and stare. You co11ld walk into a store‚ and people ~oulj turn around to rnaf<e sure that ‚you :1ere not qoin9 to steal an}&middot;thing.‚ Halk ir1to1 a rr~staurant an~ ever__t~ocl_y quits ta.lkin~i‚ and th~y lock at yotJ and th~n the)' start up a:.;ains but~a~it's ver:/ obvious that it's not eas.y to be b1ack in Grinnell~ It's v2r_y obv&middot;ious that 2/ou'r~ not 0‚lv‚10:ys ~'-fant{:d there .. 
Taylor, Die! 1 knov! an.y&middot; oT the black families 1&middot;iving in Grinnell? Yr~s~ Dr“ HPntJ?.r and his ivif.e‚ Grace‚ and his !-:.iris ~:1erc ver_Ji ver:/ good friends‚‚ ~&middot;le v10uld go to 1:heir-the blac~ stuients ~rould go t0 their house anytine iuring t y2ar‚ rea1ly. 1uit~ often they'd hav0-they 1 d fix dinrer for us or w2 1 d invite them up for our T~ar~sgivirg Dinner‚ an~ ws 1 d ;o bac~ to their house for Jess2rt and coffe? an~ crazincss aftcr~ards. Jr if you ever neefed Just to Jet away from carn~us anci ns~ded that vacation that it wasn't really ti~e for‚ we could always go stny with Crace and Doc. And that was imJortant. to have a non-college rslatccl hlack family to oo to. to talt to‚ to spend time with. That was important. That ~as important for all of us‚ I think. So our relationship ~ith them was v~ ry‚‚ very good. 
Taylor, r only know the names of a few blac~ aliJms while I ~as at Grirnel1‚ and t~at ~as because they cane hac~ to the school. Yind of to check up on us and s~e how ~e were doing type thing. ~arilyn rat1iff 1 of course‚ who's no~ with \d~issions‚ so I know lier very well. I knew Butch and Careda Roll an~; qutch and Careda started the Young‚ Gifted and Slack Gospel Choir. ThAy were real1y suroriserl to see that it was still going on. ~arilyn ?atliff‚ by the way‚ her last name was Grey‚ ~arilyn Crey‚ was one of the peo~le \Iha st1rted CSS and sh.‚~~ too‚ ‚‚‚ms very surprised to see that the organization 1.vas still al'ive. 
Taylor, &bull;';race-Gracie and ::regory Lre ca.me hack to school to get rnarrird last year. So I met them. tmd there \;‚‚‚ere other people that had just kine of corc1e and gone and kind of passed throuqh. Oh‚ Debra Tall‚ r forgot to me:ntion Oebra T;!ll. Debra Tall was ther~ when I vtas there-;ny freshman year. So that 1 s just one other person to add. And Debra came back a lot of ti~es. I can't really think of other people that we m2t‚ but there have been lots of people that stoppAd t~rough Srinnell just to see how we ~ere doing kind of thing. Ke~r in toucb vii th us. 
Taylor, l!as I happy at Grinnell? Yeah. If I had to do it all over again‚ I'd come hack to Grinn~ll. 
Taylor, “!Jl:?::ise ela'::orate on your .'H:tivities once leaving Grinnell.“ CH:ay. 1&bull;!e11‚ as I said‚ I was Press Secretary and P~sr::arch Intern for Council ma:“: Nichol 2‚s Hood. and now I'm in a training program at 1JD!V-TV Channel 4 ~Are in Detroit. it's an NSC affiliate‚ as I said. Rhat I've been doing is going from one ~epart~ent to anot~er. I just Finishe~ workin9 on a live talk show; I ~as responsi!~;‚~~ for gettin‚; 't‚he audience there every :ia}' and makinc; sure a11 sorts of little t~inss had to~~ taken caro oF li~e the videotape and makr sure it was wter~ it ~as suppos~d to be and ~ake sura t~e directors their run-dcwns‚ rnake sure e&middot;ver_y~;oCj~ !1a.d a script and a11 sorts of tinings~~.:;‚r;_ythin~j ..YOU could think of frcs ~2kfng co~fe2 to ~a~i~g sure the guest was there all risht‚ I ~a1 to do. Also‚ I ha~ to do backgroun1 researc~ for stories for th~ s~ow. I'm no~-.: }1:orki q-g in the net:;sroom‚ 2nd I fl uctuatc~ .~Jet\~&middot;ec.~n \‚1Jork in; on ne\~S stories to 1/.;ork.in9 v.‚-itr&middot;: our constn-:1er &middot;3dit()r -s.r.d doing res{?c~rch for ht.~r~ :f will then go to work on “Special Projects‚“ which handles documentaries and things like that. (Addendum: I am currently working in Special Projectswhich produces documenta~ies and special programs. I'm responsible for doing background research‚ finding file tape‚ locating sources‚ experts‚ etc. I was the Producation Coordinator for “Harvest of Pride/' a Black Hi story Month Special and now I'm working on a documentary on reemployment. I also assist with editing and other production responsibilities. I'm helping with the Easter Seals Telethon and some other projects still in the planning stages.)I worked on the political campaign-reelection campaign for Councilman Hood‚ and we were very successful. I now live in a predominantly black neighborhood‚ but it's a middle and upper-middle income neighborhood. It's a historic district in Detroit; it's called the Boston-Edison District‚ and it's very prestigious in the city. No‚ I don't work in a black neighborhood‚ I work downtown. I'll be moving downtown‚ by the way‚ when I do move‚ and that is not predominantly black. (My apartment building is about 60% black.) It's an inter-racial neighborhood. And the station is obviously inter-racial. 
Taylor, “To what extent did your courses in various disciplines address the issue of race and the black experience?“ Well‚ not a whole lot‚ really. I took-some. courses dealt with it specifically‚ like Afro-American Literature and Afro-~~erican History. Other courses‚ I had to bring it in or other black students had to bring it in to the course. So it really depended onmost of the time‚ if it wasn't for the black students who were already in the class‚ it would not have been included at all in the course curriculum. 
Taylor, Was I involved in any church at Grinnell? No‚ not really. I'd go to Chapel sometimes‚ and I would go to some of the area churches. I was a member of BLACC.-that's something else I forgot to mention. BLACC is Blacks Living a Commitment to Christ. And I was involved in that for a while. 
Taylor, What kind of impact did Grinnell have on my life? Socially‚ it didn't really have any except-well‚ no‚ that's not true. Socially‚ it taught me how to deal with people from all sorts of different backgrounds. Taught me how tor guess that's it. Taught me how to deal with people from all sorts of different backgrounds and not hold my beliefs of what they ought to be against them‚ okay? Just dealt with them as they were. Educationally‚ it made me a lot smarter after going to college for four years. It made me a lot more ~ndependent and a lot of the things that I found in working‚ is that I tend to-when I do research I go a lot deeper than the people really expect me to. I also think a lot more independently than people are used to. I'm a lot more thorough‚ I'm a lot more demanding‚ I guess‚ than a lot of people really expect for someone 22 years old to be. So I guess just my training at Grinnell has really helped me as far as my career is going. Emotionally‚ I'm a hell of a 1ot stronger than I used to be. I'm a lot more independent‚ I'm a lot more self-confident‚ I'm a lot more self-assured and all that kind of thing. I guess that's reallyabout it. Stuart‚ good luck on your project. I'm sorry it's taken me so long to do this. I work about fifteen hours a day‚ so it's taken me a while just to even have a moment to sit down and do this. I'll mail it out to you tomorrow‚ but thank you for even thinking up the idea of the oral history. I'm glad that it's done‚ and I want to find out‚ you know‚ once you get the whole thing completedI want to find out what kind of things you came up with‚ so please‚ let's keep in touch‚ okay? Have a good semester and good re-~t of the year and all that sort of thing. Bye-bye.
